interface
=======

This is an interface to send remote commands to the machine via Bluetooth

Simply pair with the machine via BT, then run 'python gui.py', select the correct serial port and connect.

requirements
-------------
* python 2.7 - not tested with older versions nor python 3.x
* pyserial - http://pyserial.sourceforge.net - serial python module; you can get it with 'pip install pyserial'
* pyside - http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide - Qt binding for python (for easy gui development)

If you have all of the above, then change into the directory which contains gui.py and run 'python gui.py'

binaries
-----------
I will put some compiled binaries on dropbox once this thing is more or less done
