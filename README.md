git basics
----------
If this is your first time using git, check out the official page (or just google for the basic commands):
http://git-scm.com

If you don't like using the command line, here is a list of nice GUI clients:

basic repo guidlines
----------------
* Please do not commit anything that is not necessary to compile the code from a Makefile.
 * avoid any binary files (please add any file extensions to the .ginignore that are not there yet)
 * including MS office files or anything else that is not .txt, unless absolutely necessary (just throw them in the Dropbox)
* Always comment on commits!
* Please try not to push code that does not compile/run to master
 * if you're doing something experimental, you're better of branching first
